"""
intake-service — multi-step patient registration + insurance + consent capture.

Both the front desk and the self-service portal POST a full intake payload here.
We create the patient chart, attach insurance coverage (if supplied), record the
signed consents, and verify payer eligibility before returning.

Inherited shortcomings (left as-is from the handoff):
  * D1 — REMEDIATED 2026-07: intake no longer logs the request body at all.
    It logs only an allowlisted, non-PHI metadata shape (schemas.log_metadata)
    — never a raw request string. Redacting the body was not enough: pattern
    redaction misses names/DOBs smuggled into free-text fields (Codex review).
    See docs/phi-logging-policy.md. The historical logs/intake-service.log
    still contains pre-fix PHI — open ops item.
  * D5 — no master patient index / match key: every /intake creates a brand new
    patients row, so one person forks into several charts (intake.yaml match_key:
    none).
  * D4 / RIV-088 — eligibility is verified inline on the request thread with no
    timeout, so a slow payer makes registration "spin ~4-5s".
  * Consents are inserted one at a time (a commit per consent).
